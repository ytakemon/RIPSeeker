Title: RIPSeeker: a statistical package for identifying
        protein-associated transcripts from RIP-seq experiments
Version: 1.17.0
Date: 2013-Apr-13
Author: Yue Li
Maintainer: Yue Li <yueli@cs.toronto.edu>
Description: Infer and discriminate RIP peaks from RIP-seq alignments
        using two-state HMM with negative binomial emission
        probability. While RIPSeeker is specifically tailored for
        RIP-seq data analysis, it also provides a suite of
        bioinformatics tools integrated within this self-contained
        software package comprehensively addressing issues ranging from
        post-alignments processing to visualization and annotation.
Depends: R (>= 2.15), methods, S4Vectors (>= 0.9.25), IRanges, GenomicRanges,
        SummarizedExperiment, Rsamtools, GenomicAlignments, rtracklayer
Suggests: biomaRt, ChIPpeakAnno, parallel, GenomicFeatures
